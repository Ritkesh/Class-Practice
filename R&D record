Increase Heap for Your Application (Run Configuration)
If you want to increase heap size for the Java app you're running, do this:

Steps:
Open Run > Edit Configurations.

Select your run configuration on the left.

In the "VM options" field, add:

-Xms512m -Xmx4g
-Xms = initial heap size (e.g., 512 MB)

-Xmx = max heap size (e.g., 4 GB)

Example: Set to start at 512MB and max at 4GB


To check jvm memory and meroy used 
first add the below details to application.properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,metrics
management.endpoint.metrics.enabled=true

add dependency of actuator in pom.xml
run mvn clean install
after that run the below mentioned endpoints


http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics

http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.max

http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.max?tag=area:heap






ocrmypdf is a native Python-based tool (not a Java process), so it's outside the JVM's memory management.
