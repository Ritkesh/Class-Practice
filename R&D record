 Increase Heap for Your Application (Run Configuration)
If you want to increase heap size for the Java app you're running, do this:

Steps:
Open Run > Edit Configurations.

Select your run configuration on the left.

In the "VM options" field, add:

-Xms512m -Xmx4g
-Xms = initial heap size (e.g., 512 MB)

-Xmx = max heap size (e.g., 4 GB)

Example: Set to start at 512MB and max at 4GB
