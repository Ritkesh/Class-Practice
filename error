Thank you for the warm welcome!

I’m truly excited to be part of the Data Management Services (DMS) team and to contribute as a Java Developer. It’s great to see the collaborative spirit between DMS and OGAdv, and I’m looking forward to working alongside everyone to support innovation and growth within the Requestable Service Offerings (RSO) pillar.

Looking forward to a great journey ahead and a successful Q2!

Best regards,
Ritkesh
